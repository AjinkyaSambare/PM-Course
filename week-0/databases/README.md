## Suggested Learning Path

1. **Start with Basics**: Read "How Databases Work" to understand fundamental concepts
2. **Understand SQL**: Go through "How Does SQL Database Work" 
3. **Deep Dive**: Explore "Unboxing a Database" and "A Comprehensive Guide to Database Internals"
4. **Physical Storage**: Study "How Tables and Indexes are Stored on Disk and Queried"
5. **Indexing**: Study how indexing works internally for performance insights
6. **Academic Foundation**: Review MIT Database Systems materials for theoretical depth
7. **Advanced Topics**: Use the Database Internals Notes and Awesome Database Learning resources
8. **Reference**: Keep GeeksforGeeks DBMS handy for specific topics

## Why This Matters for Product Managers

- **Performance Decisions**: Understanding indexing helps in feature design that scales
- **Architecture Choices**: Knowledge of database internals aids in system design discussions
- **Cost Optimization**: Better understanding leads to more efficient database usage
- **Technical Credibility**: Speak confidently with engineering teams about data layer concerns
- **Problem Solving**: Diagnose and propose solutions for data-related issues

## Key Concepts to Focus On

1. **Storage Engines**: How data is physically stored and retrieved
2. **Query Processing**: How SQL queries are parsed, optimized, and executed
3. **Indexing**: B-trees, hash indexes, and their performance implications
4. **Transactions**: ACID properties and isolation levels
5. **Caching**: Buffer pools and query result caching
6. **Concurrency**: Locking mechanisms and MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

## Practical Applications

As you learn these concepts, think about:
- How would different indexing strategies affect your product's search feature?
- What are the trade-offs between consistency and performance in your use case?
- How can you design features that minimize database load?
- When should you consider NoSQL vs SQL for different features?

Happy learning! ðŸš€
